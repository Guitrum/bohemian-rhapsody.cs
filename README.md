# Bohemiam Rhapsody in C♯

Inspired by that cute image of Bohemiam Rhapsody cleverly written
in the [C Sharp](https://www.microsoft.com/net/Learn/Languages#csharp) programming language.

This is a working version of that code snippet, written in C Sharp, that also prints the intro to
Bohemiam Rhapsody to the console.

Enjoy!
